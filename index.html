  <p> Only Wanda remains on the Atlantic storm names list after Hurricane Sam and Tropical Storm Victor made their way through the Atlantic this week.  Though they're staying clear of New York City, they remind us two months remain of a busy hurricane season, and even New Yorkers should remain vigilant. <p>

  <p> If you’re a recent transplant or planning to make a move to the city, take this season as a warning: climate change has made preparing for severe storms an essential facet of New York City living. <p>

  <p> In early September, remnants of Hurricane Ida managed to devastate the city--not with the storm surge that blasted Louisiana’s coast--but with unexpected torrential rainfall that flooded the city's subway system, roads and basements. <p>

  <p>Though the tragic flooding begged government action and updates to the city’s infrastructure, here is what you should do as soon as you settle into the Big Apple. </p>

  <h2> Be in the loop </h2>

  <p> As a new resident of New York City, it’s a good idea to register for the city’s official emergency communications program. Sign up for notifications at <a href=https://NYC.gov/notifynyc> nyc.gov</a>, downloading the Notify NYC app or dialing 311. Aside from severe weather information and evacuation notices, you can opt to receive messages on mass transit and other significant events.</p>

  <h2> Are you in the zone? </h2>
    <img src="zones.png" alt="zoning icon"/>
  <p> Found your dream NYC apartment? Now find out if it’s located in one of the city’s six evacuation zones prone to the most severe storm surge flooding. These are mainly coastal areas of the city that border rivers or ocean, but it’s important to check before evacuation orders are issued. You can check your zone using <a href=https://maps.nyc.gov/hurricane/#> this map</a>. </p>

  <p> Flood zones are different from evacuation zones, and you should not assume a need to evacuate based on your flood zone. Find more information about flood zones in NYC at <a href=https://NYC.gov/floodmaps> nyc.gov</a> or <a href=https://floodhelpny.org> floodhelp.org.</a> </p>

  <h2> Gather the essentials </h2>

  <p> Yes, space is limited in NYC apartments, but make room for an emergency supply kit. Fill a box with non-perishable foods, a gallon of water, basic first aid supplies and medications, a flashlight, candles, duct tape, and a portable phone charger (fully charged). For more kit ideas, check out <a href=https://ready.gov>ready.gov</a>. </p>


  <h2> Love thy neighbor </h2>
  <img src="help others.png" alt="care icon"/>
  <p> Don’t forget about those around you. For pets, make sure your supply kit includes pet food and have a pet carrier ready to go in case of evacuation. </p>
  <p> Check on vulnerable neighbors, friends, and family members. Help them complete this checklist, especially if they don’t have internet access or the ability to gather their supplies. </p>
